This is my Laravel Task Assesment for Wiztecbd 

I've used an frontend tamplate and tried to make it as the provied figma design. The blog page fatches data from database and shows in the fronend, i've also added pagination to the blog page.
Furthermore, there is a button in every blog item which redirect to specific blog item details page.
The blog details page has details of specific blog and a functional comment section where upon submitting comment the comment gets store to database for specific blog id. Lastly, the search button is functional, upon click the serach button it show fillterd blogs if there is no matching search quary then the page will show no blog found
